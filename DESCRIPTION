Title: An R package of data related to harbor seal counts in Lake Iliamna,
    Alaska
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: 'Josh M London <josh.london@noaa.gov> [aut,cre]'
Description: This R data package provides an interface for accessing harbor
    seal aerial survey data from Iliamna Lake, Alaska, USA. The data have been
    collated from three previously published sources (Mathisen and Kline 1992;
    Small 2001; ABR 2011 ... see vignette for full citations) and newly
    available data from the NOAA National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML). The
    survey years range between 1984 and 2013. Counts are reported as summed
    totals across all identified waypoints in the lake for each survey date. In
    addition, the package provides a SpatialPointsDataFrame of all identified
    harbor seal waypoints in the lake. These waypoints have been collated
    across all of the surveys into a naming scheme consistent with current NMML
    Alaska statewide harbor seal protocols.
