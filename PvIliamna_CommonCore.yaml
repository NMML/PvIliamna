  PvIliamna: An R package of data related to harbor seal counts in Lake Iliamna, Alaska
description: >
  This R data package provides an interface for accessing harbor seal aerial survey data from
  Iliamna Lake, Alaska, USA. The data have been collated from three previously published sources
  (Mathisen and Kline 1992; Small 2001; ABR 2011) and newly available data from the NOAA National
  Marine Mammal Laboratory. The survey years range between 1983 and 2013. Counts are reported as
  summed totals across all identified waypoints in the lake for each survey date. In addition,
  the package provides a SpatialPointsDataFrame of all identified harbor seal waypoints in the
  lake. These waypoints have been collated across all of the surveys into a naming scheme
  consistent with current NMML Alaska statewide harbor seal protocols.
